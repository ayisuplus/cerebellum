Performs statistical analysis of Zeek conn.log connection intervals to detect C2 beaconing patterns. Uses the ZAT library to load Zeek logs into Pandas DataFrames, calculates inter-arrival time standard deviation, and flags periodic connections with low jitter. Use when hunting for command-and-contr
